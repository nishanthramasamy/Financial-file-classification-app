#  Financial-file-classification-app - For finance teams

**Overview:**

Financial-file-classifier is a simple streamlit application that aims to classify an html file which related to 'FINANCE' into five different categories like Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, Income statement, Notes and Others]. It tackles the challenge of extracting text from 2500+ files from 5 different classes and developing a model to classify an unknown document into the specific category by utilizing 'BeautifulSoup' to extract the data and 'nltk' module to process, clean and sklearn's ML models to train and build the application.

**Features:**

*  **Engaging and User-Friendly:** The repository consists of a app.py file, which runs a streamlit app with a simple user interface that helps you upload your html file and gives the file type as the output.
*  **Powerful and Efficient:** Built with logistic regression/ Random classifier, it delivers with the accuracy of 94%.
*  **Customizable and Adaptable:** The project allows for switching over to different model, Logistic regression or Random Forest Classifier to cater to diverse needs and preferences.

**Why You Should Be Interested:**

*  **Continuous Learning:** My commitment to continuous improvement drives me to utilize BERT and other LLM" models to improve the functioning of the application.
*  **Collaboration Driven:** I'm open to collaboration and welcome suggestions from like-minded individuals.
